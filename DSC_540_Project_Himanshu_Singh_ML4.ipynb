    "In order to utilize the API, the date was changed to UTC timestamp, Kelvin was converted to Celsius and stored in .csv file. Because we have more than 13K records and limit of 1000 API calls, a loop was added to make 950 calls a day. API response was added to the .csv file.\n",

    "The key restrictions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "API Key and Rate Limits: We must use a valid API key and adhere to the call limits defined by the specific plan (free tier has strict limits).\n",
    "Commercial Use: The Free plan is generally restricted to non-commercial use only. For commercial products (like apps with subscriptions or ads), you must purchase a paid subscription.\n",
    "Attribution: Free and some paid plans require you to display an attribution (e.g., \"Weather data provided by OpenWeather\") in the visible part of the solution.\n",
    "Redistribution: The license dictates whether you can redistribute the raw data or only \"non-retrievable value-added services\" built using the data. Reselling the original data is usually prohibited.\n",
    "Failure to comply can result in the API key being revoked or legal action. You must check the current OpenWeather license for the specific plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What risks could be created based on the transformations done?\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of the temperature and time should be consistent. The time unit should match on what is required by API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Did you make any assumptions in cleaning/transforming the data?\n",
    "Because of limit on API, I had to restrict API call to 1000 per day which will be ran everyday to fetch all information required by data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was your data sourced/verified for credibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "My response capability is based on the information I was trained on (a massive dataset of text and code) and, for current or specific inquiries, the information I can retrieve using my Google Search tool. I do not have a private, project-specific dataset of COVID-19 that I have sourced or verified.\n",
    "However I am relying on https://ourworldindata.org which sources data from Authentic sources\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Was your data acquired in an ethical way?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenWeather's own data acquisition, is typically aggregate information from national weather services, satellite imagery, radar data, and commercial sensor networks. The ethical requirement for a user is to adhere strictly to their Terms of Service (e.g., attribution, commercial use restrictions) to respect their licensing agreements and data collection efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How would you mitigate any of the ethical implications you have identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate ethical implications when using the OpenWeather API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict Compliance & Licensing: Purchase the appropriate commercial license if the project generates revenue (even via ads), and strictly adhere to all API call limits to respect their infrastructure investment.\n",
    "Attribution: Clearly and prominently display the required attribution (\"Weather data provided by OpenWeather\") in the user interface where the data is presented.\n",
    "Privacy: Since weather data is generally not personal, focus on internal data security. Never expose or log the API key in public repositories or client-side code.\n",
    "Transparency: If the solution uses the data for critical decisions (e.g., automated farming), clearly communicate the data source and its inherent limitations (e.g., forecast accuracy) to end-users."
